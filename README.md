# Network-Scanning-Traffic-Analysis-Lab-Nmap-Wireshark-Scapy-
This repository documents my Ethical Hacking lab, covering Nmap host discovery, OS detection, and service enumeration; SMB enumeration via Nmap scripts; packet capture and analysis with tcpdump/Wireshark; and interactive packet crafting, sniffing, and filtering using Scapy, all in a controlled lab environment.
